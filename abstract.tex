TO REDO !!!
Blockchain technologies have improved constantly in recent years since the introduction of Bitcoin and with this growth of the technology, the possible applications are being realised, going from the cryptocurrencies to smart contracts and consortium networks, allowing for the integration of business logic into the ledger.Â With this increase in functionality, it is becoming apparent that the use of this technology should not be limited to devices with powerful and specialised hardware. In order to further the functionality of this technology, being able to run a blockchain network on a network of low powered devices is required.

This thesis aims to build a enterprise grade blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric on a series of low powered Internet of Things devices, specifically Raspberry Pis. It also aims to test and benchmark the created network requiring the implementation of a testing suite.
