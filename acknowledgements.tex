\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{ack}

This work has been inspired by Ambrose Hill and Dr. Salil Kanhere, who have gave me the initial idea and have guided my research so far. I would also like to thank Dr. Helen Paik who has also provided guidance throughout this term. I also acknowledge all the staff within the UNSW faculty of Engineering whose past efforts have allowed me to conduct this thesis. 

I would also like to acknowledge Isaac Hooge and Dennis Gann, who are apart of my supervision group, for their efforts in their own thesis' as it has helped me form a better idea of my own thesis.
